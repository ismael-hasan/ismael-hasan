### Who I am 

Hi there! I am Ismael Hasan Romero. I am a Software Engineer specialized in Information Retrieval and Distributed Systems. At the moment, I am studying to have the credentials to teach Vocational Training studies - such as Software Development. 

### Where I worked
After finishing my studies, my career did lead me to work with the [Information Retrieval Lab](https://www.dc.fi.udc.es/ir/) as a Software Engineer for 4 years, where my specialization in Information Retrieval started; don´t know what Information Retrieval is? Simplifying it *a whole lot*, it is all about search. 

After that I moved to The Netherlands where I worked with [Attivio](https://www.attivio.com/) technologies, a search ecosystem based in [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/), developing web search applications. Three years passed and my next destination was Abu Dabi, where I transitioned to a role more oriented to architecture (still, a lot of software development involved!). 

My next step was to move to open source software, working for [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/), an ecosystem of distributed software which started as a pure search distributed engine as a Support Engineer. This gave me the opportunity to become more acquainted with open source, with the startups environment - the company had grown to around 4x when I moved to the next challenge -, and in general with working daily with customers (a great chance to improve soft skills!). Apart from doing Support, I got the change to write a couple of blog post, [A Practical Introduction to Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/es/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-elasticsearch) and [How to Tune Elastic Beats Performance: A Practical Example with Batch Size, Worker Count, and More](https://www.elastic.co/es/blog/how-to-tune-elastic-beats-performance-a-practical-example-with-batch-size-worker-count-and-more)

My last software products/development job was at [Confluent](www.confluent.io), *A self-managed, enterprise-grade distribution of Apache Kafka*, where I worked as a Customer Success Technical Architect, helping customers with their Confluent deployments (mostly, from the architectural point of view). 

Finally, in 2022 and 2023, I have been teaching the subject Requirements Engineering at the University of a Coruña, part of the University Degree in Software Engineering - also, in 2022 I managed the practical assignments in the subject Information Retrieval, part of the University Degree in Data Engineering. 

### Something more about me! 
One of the things that I like the most is sharing what I did learn in my career. I enjoy giving conferences, being the last one [Vamos a llevarnos bien, porque si no van a haber hondonadas de ostias aquí, ¡eh!](https://pulpocon.es/talk/isma-hasan/), in 2023, where I discuss on how to de-escalate stressful situations with customers or colleagues, aiming to have the best outcome for everybody involved in difficult situations.
